- **View Students**: Display the list of all students.
- **Update Student**: Update existing student details.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student's record from the system.
- **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Future Enhancements
- Data Persistence: Store student data in a database (SQLite, MySQL) or a file (CSV, JSON).
- GUI: Implement a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
- Advanced Search: Add features to search for students by different criteria (name, grade, etc.).
- Error Handling: Add more comprehensive error checking and validation.
