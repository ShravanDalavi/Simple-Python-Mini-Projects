This is a simple Python script to fetch and display the current weather for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The script takes a city name as input and retrieves the current weather information, including the weather description and temperature in Celsius. It handles various exceptions that may occur during the API request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
