# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid, and the game detects a win or a tie.

## Description

The game starts with player X. Players click on the buttons to mark their moves. The game checks for a win after each move. If a player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python installations)
