```

---

### 3. Explore the Projects
Each mini-project is stored in its own directory. You can browse through the folders to find the projects of interest. Each folder contains:
- A Python file (`*.py`) with the source code for the project.
- A `README.md` file (if available) with a brief description of the project.

---

### 4. Run a Project
To run a specific project:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory, e.g.,
   ```bash
   cd Project-Name
   ```
3. Run the Python file using:
   ```bash
   python project_name.py
   ```

Replace `project_name.py` with the actual file name.

---

### 5. Modify or Extend Projects
Feel free to modify the projects to experiment with the code and add new features. To edit a project:
1. Open the project file in your favorite code editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, or Sublime Text).
2. Make your changes and save the file.
3. Run the project to test your changes.

---

 ## Prerequisites
Before running the projects, ensure you have:
1. Python installed (version 3.x is recommended). You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Basic knowledge of Python programming.

## How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="20" />
1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/ShravanDalavi/Simple-Python-Mini-Projects) and click the big green ‚ûû  **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ‚ûû [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/shravandalavi/Simple-Python-Mini-Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

  ![image](https://github.com/ShravanDalavi/Simple-Python-Mini-Projects/assets/172488772/fe6f519f-afbd-49d1-9efc-5f6b5f234340)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    **`Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`**
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
